The data set is collected as part of a study on the feasibility of crowd-sourced price data collection. 
 Price data was collected by non-professionals for thirty specific food items across several months in eight countries. 
 The Excel file contains geographic data (city and country), time data (date of observation), product information (name, quantity) and price (standardized quantities, prices converted to comparable currency).
 This project consists of visualizations done using story and dashboards to represent the information in a seamless manner to aid in the analysis of price data collected. Visualization techniques used in this project are geotagging, drill down, story board, line chart and dashboard
